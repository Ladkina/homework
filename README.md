***Hello! My name is Dasha, I'm 17 y.o. I'm from Magnitogorsk. But now I live in Moscow. 
I'm keen on dancing and listening to music. My favourite musicians are:
* Eminem
* Rihanna
* Kendrick Lamar
* Frank Ocean
* Sam Smith
* Miley Cyrus 
* Kanye West
* MATRANG

***I enjoy reading. "Les miserables" by Victor Hugo is my most-liked book.***

***I'm quite easy-going person. Can't imagine my life without friends and food. Cakes and chokolates are the best food for me. However, I'm trying to start eating healthily.
I go to fitness club which is called "X-Fit". It's amazing. I go to gym 3-4 times a week. I wish I could train more but (unfortenutally) I have to do a lot of homework.
Here you can see the table of my trainings.***
